## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

If you just want to update the HTML report, then you can copy the
`src/proksee-batch/data/data.example` directory to
`src/proksee-batch/data/data`, and then work with the
`src/proksee-batch/data/report.html` file directly in the source code.

For modifying the main Python package code, you will need Python 3.7+ and the
following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox]
- [nox-poetry]

Poetry is the project/package manager, and Nox is the automation tool for
testing.

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```console
$ poetry run python
$ poetry run proksee-batch
```

[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/
[nox-poetry]: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

[pytest]: https://pytest.readthedocs.io/

Unit tests can be run via:

```console
$ poetry run pytest
```

Integration tests can be run via (involves accessing the Proksee server, etc.):

```console
$ poetry run pytest tests/integration_tests.py
```

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.

## How to update the version on the Python Package Index (PyPI)

When the package version is updated in the `pyproject.toml` file and pushed to
GitHub, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically publish the new version
to PyPI. To update the version, use the `poetry version` command with `major`,
`minor`, or `patch` as the argument. For example, to update the version to a new
patch release, run the following command:

```console
$ poetry version patch
```
